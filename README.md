dotfiles
========

mostly a bunch of configs that revolve around my i3-gaps setup


Usage
-----

clone this repo & run the setup.sh script

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/merothh/dotfiles
    bash ~/dotfiles/setup.sh 

Symlinks are created so that apps can find the dotfiles and they will update on a ``git
pull``
